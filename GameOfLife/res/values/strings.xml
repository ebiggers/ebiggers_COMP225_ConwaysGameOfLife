      The Game of Life is a cellular automaton.  Each
      generation, a live cell continues living only if it is
      bordered by exactly 2 or 3 other live cells, and a
      dead cell comes to life only if it is bordered by
      exactly 2 live cells.  The border cells of a cell are
      considered to be the ring of 8 cells surrounding it.
